More about the gulp build from the [official website](https://gulpjs.com/)

## Download on Windows

1. Downloading Node.js from the [official site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Open powershell on behalf of the administrator and enter `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` so that in the future there will be no errors associated with the lack of certain rights
3. Run the command `npm install gulp-cli -g` in the console. This command installs Gulp globally, that is, you can run it from any folder on your computer.

## Download on macOS

1. Before installing, make sure that on device is installed [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 
2. After that, in the terminal, write this command `sudo npm install gulp-cli -g`
